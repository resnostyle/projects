 * The second page is a photo upload page. Here a file upload form is shown to the user which has an 
Upload button too. The User ID value from the userâ€™s session should show at the top. The user selects 
an image file to upload and clicks Upload. The server must only accept files that have a .PNG or .JPG 
extension and are not larger than 1MB in size.  If the check fails, the page reloads and an inline 
error should show at the top indicating what the error was.  If the file is good, the third web page 
should be shown to the user.
